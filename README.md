## This is an UT INF385T Final Project

### "What makes for a good baby name?" Sometimes people name their babies with their names. Besides, will people name their dog just like naming their human baby? Inspired by the "Big Bang Theory", we decide to make an analysis about the naming trends in US.

### The project analyses two relationships. First, analyze the top 10 baby names in each race and the most popular adult name in each race. Second, analyze the popular dog names and the popular adult name. The goal of the project is to determine if the adult name influences the dog and baby's naming.
